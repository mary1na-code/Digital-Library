# 📖 Digital Library Manager

## Overview  
A web application to manage a personal library. Users can add books with details (title, author, pages, read/unread) and view them as interactive cards. Data is persisted using **localStorage** so the library remains after refresh.

## Purpose  
Built to practice and showcase **JavaScript fundamentals**, **object-oriented programming**, and **DOM manipulation**. Demonstrates CRUD operations, state management, and dynamic rendering in a clean, scalable architecture.

## Features  
- Add, display, and remove books  
- Toggle read/unread status  
- Data persistence with localStorage  
- Class-based structure (`Book` and `Library` classes)  
- Extendable for search, sorting, and API integration (e.g., book covers from Open Library)

## Tech Stack  
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript (ES6 Classes, localStorage)
